      <li>What are we doing good on our website that we should keep on the redesign?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Hero image isn’t bad - I like the “ABC” art. Nav is good. “Meet our Baristas” is good engaging content</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Is there anything we could potentially highlight on the website that will display the traits that make our organization enjoyable to work for or be a customer of?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Highlight the baristas better  - carousel?</li>
        <li>Show more images of coffee and donuts - large product landing page?</li>
        <li>Maybe another carousel of recent customer reviews.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>What are we best known for? What makes us different (in a positive light) from our competitors? (i.e.: customer service, quality products, etc.)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Coffee & donuts. We’re different because of donuts. We’re personable, friendly. Drive-thru available. More of a personal touch due to being a small business.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul></td>
    <td> <ul>
      <li>Are there any aspects in the usability of our website that would affect our target audience?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Navigation needs to be cleaned up/organized better.</li>
        <li>Mobile site needs work.</li>
        <li>Needs alt text, badly, for images. “Title” tag for links.</li>
        <li>Contrast in menu colors (or colors in general)</li>
        <li>Need a menu for boba tea</li>
        </ul>
      <li>What are some of the complaints that we receive from our website that we could fix?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Menu doesn’t have pictures of any of the drinks, or descriptions for the items. No prices for items either.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Is there something that is currently non-existent that should be put in place?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Customer loyalty/newsletter program. Carousel of recent social media posts. Showcase reviews/testimonials?</li>
        <li>“Order online” or “order here” or link to doordash/UberEats - make it static across all pages (nav bar?)</li>
        </ul>

    <tr>
      <td><ul>
        <li>Is there a change in the economy, market, politics that the company can benefit from and should think about as we are redesigning our website?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Doordash/delivery options. Social media marketing is mandatory, not optional. Coldbrew should be an option. Offer limited boutique coffee roasts (beans or pre-ground) - sell online as well. Seasonal drinks.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Is there a change in the population which could potentially change the target audience?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Target younger audience and their preference for boba/cold coffee</li>
          <li>Delivery = target people who are staying at home (contactless delivery)</li>
          <li>Men are becoming more and more comfortable buying coffee other than espresso/black coffee - make something to target that audience.</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Is there new technology that is available to help propel the goals for the company that may not have existed in the past?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>TikTok - younger employees - generate customer engagement.</li>
          <li>Release an app for customers - ordering, paying, loyalty program - rewards system. Stamp cards?</li>
          <li>Alliances: 1) target teachers 2) students - college, mainly 3) nurses/healthcare workers. Free coffee/donuts for essential workers. Coupons. “Like this/share this” for discounts/marketing.</li>
          </ul>
      </ul></td>
      <td> <ul>
        <li>The organization may benefit by having contingency plans to address them should they occur such as notifications, advertisements for specific products, communication with specific departments, alliances with other businesses, etc.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Biggest threat: government shuts down restaurants again.</li>
          <li>Other coffee shops. Bad PR. Location - need to move?</li>
          </ul>
        <li>Classify them by their “seriousness” and “probability of occurrence”</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Most serious and most likely: government shut down.</li>
          <li>Next most serious: bad PR. Not that likely, but possible.</li>
          <li>Location: much less likely, not that serious due to delivery option, drive-thru.</li>
